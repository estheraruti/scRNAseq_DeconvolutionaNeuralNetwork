Bradykinin promotes immune responses in differentiated embryonic neurospheres carrying APP swe and PS1
dE9 mutations
(Submitter supplied) Neural stem cells (NSCs) can be cultivated from developing brains, reproducing many of the processes
that occur during neural development. They can be isolated from a variety of animal models, such as transgenic mice
carrying mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN 1 and 2), characteristic of familial
Alzheimer ’s Disease (AD). Modulating the development of these cells with inflammation-related peptides, like bradykinin
(BK) and its antagonist HOE-140, enables the understanding of the impact of such molecules on the genetic load of treated
neurospheres.  more...

Gene expression profiles of depletion of Daxx and HOTAIR
(Submitter supplied) In this study , we found that Daxx may modulate HOT AIR stability , and therefore, regulate H3K27me3
levels. To further examine the possible mechanism and biological consequence, we separately knocked down Daxx and
HOTAIR with a lentivirus plasmid constructed with short hairpin RNA  and siRNA  oligonucleotides, respectively . We then
used microarray analysis to identify several candidate genes regulated under the Daxx-HOT AIR axis.

Ablation of Max expression induces meiotic onset in sexually undifferentiated germ cells
(Submitter supplied) MAX (MYC Associated Factor X) is generally known as a mandatory partner for MYC transcription
factor , which activates various genes involved in cell growth and metabolism. On the other hand, MAX, when interacting
with MGA, forms the polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1.6, one of the subtypes of PRC1, which directs the
transcriptionally repressed chromatin state. Although physiological significance is not known at present, we have previously
demonstrated that mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) bear a potential to onset meiosis, albeit not germ cells, and PRC1.6
prevent ESCs from their ectopic onset of meiosis (Suzuki et al., 2016, Nat.  more...

Resistance to Naïve and Formative Pluripotency Conversion in RSeT Human Embryonic Stem Cells
(Submitter supplied) One of the most important properties of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is related to their primed
and naïve pluripotent states. Our previous meta-analysis indicates the existence of heterogeneous pluripotent states
derived from diverse naïve protocols. In this study , we have characterized a commercial medium (RSeT)-based pluripotent
state under various growth conditions. Notably , RSeT  hESCs can circumvent hypoxic growth conditions as required by
naïve hESCs, in which some RSeT  cells (e.g., H1 cells) exhibit much lower single cell plating ef ficiency , having altered or
much retarded cell growth under both normoxia and hypoxia.  more...

Differentiated embryonic neurospheres from familial Alzheimer’s disease model show Innate Immune and Glial
Cell Responses
(Submitter supplied) Proteins involved in the Alzheimer ’s disease (AD), such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and
presenilin-1 (PS1), play critical roles in early development of the central nervous system (CNS), as well as in innate immune
and glial cell responses. However , it is unknown whether these alterations start on development of the CNS of carriers of
APPswe and PS1dE9 mutations , associated with familial AD. Using microarray technology we studied the genome-wide
gene expression profiles in the dif ferentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from wild-type (WT) and APPswe/PS1dE9
embryo  telencephalon. Dif ferential gene expression analysis indicated the occurrence of strong innate immune and glial
cell responses in APPswe/PS1dE9 neurospheres, involving mainly microglial cells, inflammatory mediators and
chemokines. APPswe/PS1dE9 cells expressed up to 100-fold more CCL12, CCL5, CCL3, C3, CX3CR1, TLR2 and TNF-
alpha, which was confirmed by real time PCR. The expression of activated microglia marker Iba-1 was also 20-fold
upregulated in APPswe/PS1dE9 cells. The secretome of APPswe/PSldE9 dif ferentiated NPCs increased the
chemoattraction of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared to the secretome of WT  cells. Taken together ,
our results demonstrated that neurogenic niche obtained from dif ferentiation of embryonic APPswe/PS1dE9 neurospheres
is an excellent model for AD in vitro, since this culture spontaneously presents several alterations observed in the adult-
brain with this pathology . Moreover , our data strengthen pathophysiological hypotheses that propose an early
neurodevelopmental origin for familial AD.

125.Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell formation in a BCR-ABL inducible expression embryonic stem cell
model
(Submitter supplied) Generating hematopoietic stem cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) has been a long lasting quest in
the field of hematology . Previous studies suggested that the enforced expression of BCR-ABL, the oncogenic driver of
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in hematopoietic cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is suf ficient to
confer on them in vivo long-term repopulating potential. To uncover more precisely the events regulated by BCR-ABL
expression during the course of ESC dif ferentiation, we engineered a doxycycline inducible system to modulate BCR-ABL
expression.

(Submitter supplied) Long non-coding RNA  ESRG was first identified in our previous study , but its physiological function,
regulatory and action mechanisms in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) remain largely unexplored. Here, we found that
ESRG is specifically and highly expressed in hPSCs, and its transcription is directly regulated by OCT4, suggesting that
ESRG may be an integral component of the core regulatory circuit regulating the pluripotent state of hPSCs.  more...

Expression data of GFP-GnRH neurons during rat embryonic development
(Submitter supplied) During development, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are born in the nasal placode
and migrate to the hypothalamus, where they position to regulate sexual reproduction. Defective GnRH neuron
development may lead to GnRH deficiency (GD) which is characterized by absent or delayed puberty . Several GD causative
genes have been identified so far , but half of the cases are still idiopathic. The identification of candidate genes is also
hampered by the dif ficulty in isolating and studying GnRH neurons, which are small in number , develop in a short
developmental window and lack specific markers. Gene expression profiles of GnRH neurons are lacking, as obtaining
primary GnRH neurons is challenging and no reports on gene expression profiles during the whole developmental process
of GnRH neurons are available. In this work, we obtained the transcriptomic profile of sorted GFP-positive and unsorted
GFP-negative cells from Gnrh1-GFP  rat embryos at three developmental stages, representing the initiation (embryonic day
(E)14), the peak (E17) and the completion of GnRH neuronal migration (E20).

alveolar homeostasis and dampen inflammation. By mapping cross-species AM development stages to clinical lung
samples, we discovered that COVID-19 is marked by defective GM-CSF-dependent AM instruction and accumulation of
proinflammatory macrophages. In a multi-center , open-label, randomized, controlled trial in 81 non-ventilated COVID-19
patients with respiratory failure, we found that inhalation of rhu-GM-CSF did not improve mean oxygenation parameters

cancer cells may emerge from senescent cells. The goal of this study is to determine if transformed cells after senescence

Transciptional profile of pericytes and stromal cells in bleomycin lung injury
(Submitter supplied) W e previously showed that pericyte-like cells derived from the FoxD1-lineage contribute to
myofibroblasts following bleomycin-induced lung injury . However , their functional significance in lung fibrosis remains
unknown. In this study , we used a model of lung pericyte-like cell ablation to test the hypothesis that pericyte-like cell
ablation attenuates lung fibrosis in bleomycin-induced lung injury . Methods: Lung fibrosis was induced by intratracheal
instillation of bleomycin. To ablate pericyte-like cells in the lung, diphtheria toxin (DT) was administered to Foxd1-
Cre;Rosa26-iDTR mice at two dif ferent phases of bleomycin-induced lung injury . For early ablation, we co-administered
bleomycin with DT  and harvested mice at days 7 and 21. To test the ef fect of ablation after acute injury , we delivered DT  7
days after bleomycin administration. W e assessed fibrosis by lung hydroxyproline content and semiquantitative analysis of
picrosirius red-staining. W e performed bronchoalveolar lavage to determine cell count and dif ferential. W e also interrogated
genome-wide mRNA  expression at day 7 post injury in whole lung RNA. W e focused on the following cell populations for the
transcriptional profiling experiments: FoxD1-derived+/Coll-GFP– pericytes (Peri), FoxD1-derived+/Coll-GFP+ pericytes
(PeriFibro), and FoxD1-derived–/Coll-GFP+ stromal fibroblasts (Fibro).Results: Compared to DT -insensitive littermates
where pericyte-like cells were not ablated, DT -sensitive animals exhibited no dif ference in fibrosis at day 21 both in the early
and late pericyte ablation models. However , early ablation of pericytes reduced acute lung inflammation, as indicated by
decreased inflammatory cells. Our data confirm a role for pericytes in regulating pulmonary inflammation in early lung injury .

Caliban regulates mitochondrial morphology and redox state in enterocytes to maintain intestinal homeostasis
in Drosophila
(Submitter supplied) Precise regulation of stem cell activity is crucial for tissue homeostasis. In Drosophila, intestinal stem
cells (ISCs) maintain the midgut epithelium and respond to oxidative challenges by increasing proliferation rates. However ,
the connection between intestinal homeostasis and redox signaling remains obscure. Here we identify Caliban (Clbn) as a
novel mitochondrial protein involved in regulating the cellular redox state in enterocytes (ECs) and the proliferative activity of
ISCs.  more...

Evolutionary Origin of Vertebrate Oct4/POUV Functions in Supporting Pluripotency
(Submitter supplied) Pluripotency is the capacity of early embryonic cells to make all the future lineages of the organism,
and the existence of a pluripotent population of cells is important to both germ cell function and the pool of progenitor cells
that enable vertebrate development to proceed over time through the process of gastrulation. Oct4, a class V POU
transcription factor , is required for maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induction of pluripotency

A molecular framework for control of oriented cell division in the Arabidopsis embryo
(Submitter supplied) Premitotic control of cell division orientation is critical for plant development, as cell walls prevent
extensive cell remodelling or migration. Whilst many divisions are proliferative and add cells to existing tissues, some
divisions are formative, and generate new tissue layers or growth axes. Such formative divisions are often asymmetric in
nature, producing daughters with dif ferent fates. W e have previously shown that in the Arabidopsis thaliana embryo ,
developmental asymmetry is correlated with geometric asymmetry , creating daughter cells of unequal volume.  more...

AKT signaling promotes epigenetic reprogramming via upregulation of TET and its cofactor, alpha-ketoglutarate

(Submitter supplied) Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT  signaling participates in cellular proliferation, survival, and
tumorigenesis as well as cellular reprogramming including generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In this
study , we revealed that activation of AKT in somatic cells undergoing reprogramming enhances epigenetic reprogramming.
Activated AKT in reprogramming cells triggers elevated anabolic glucose metabolism, and, accordingly , increases the level
of α-ketoglutarate (αKG) which is an essential cofactor for the enzymatic activity of the 5-methylcytosine (5mC) dioxygenase
TET. more...

IGF2BP1 is required for hepatic outgrowth during early liver development in zebrafish
(Submitter supplied) IGF2BPs, a subclass of RNA-binding proteins, regulate cellular dif ferentiation, proliferation and
migration during mutiple organs development, but its function still remains unclear . Here, we provide the in vivo evidence
that Igf2bp1 is pivotal during liver development by using zebrafish as a model organism. Whole-mount in situ hybridization
showed that igf2bp1 was highly expressed in liver , and the morpholino knockdown had no ef fect on hepatoblast
differentiation, but the liver size was significantly reduced.  more...

(Submitter supplied) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common hematologic malignancy in adults. While B
cell-targeted therapies have revolutionized treatment, the underlying molecular targets of disease have not been addressed.
A quarter of CLL  patients have somatic trisomy 12 (tri12) which confers intermediate risk, and is otherwise embryonically
lethal. Here, we report human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) harboring tri12 uniquely genocopy and phenocopy tri12 CLL.

(Submitter supplied) Serotonin (5-HT) neurons, the major components of the raphe nuclei, arise from ventral hindbrain
progenitors. Based on the anatomical location and axonal projection, 5-HT  neurons are coarsely divided into rostral and
caudal groups. Here, we propose a novel strategy to generate hindbrain 5-HT  neurons from human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs), which involves the formation of ventral-type neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and stimulation of the hindbrain 5-HT
neural development.  more...

remodeling and fibrosis, caused by excessive deposition of connective tissue after injury , which impairs organ function. It is
estimated that 45% of deaths in developed countries are linked to chronic fibrosis, yet current drugs on the market are both
inefficient and non-specific to this condition [1].  more...

Expression data from Arabidopsis plants overexpressing CLE2 in roots
(Submitter supplied) Plant hormones and small secretory peptides often function as environmental stress mediators. Some
recent reports indicate that small secretory peptides, such as CLA VATA3/EMBR YO SURROUNDING REGION-RELA TED

Expression data from mouse pontine nucleus
(Submitter supplied) During brain development, layer 5 neurons distributed across most areas of the neocortex innervate
the pontine nuclei (basilar pons) by the initiation and extension of collateral branches interstitially along their corticospinally
extending axons. W e used microarrays to compare gene expression profiles of pontine nucleus when axon collaterals
towards the pontine nucleus start to extend (embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) to postnatal day 1 (P1)), and/or throughout the
development (E17.5-P14) in order to understand genetic programs that regulate axon collaterals formation.

486.Transcriptional Changes in Rat Dorsal Root Ganglia Neurons During Stretch-Mediated Axon Growth
(Submitter supplied) The development of meter-long axons within the nervous system is a remarkable, yet unresolved
biological process. The most widely studied aspects of neuronal growth focus on the extension and chemotropism of growth
cones. However , over the course of organismal development, short axons elongate up to one meter in length with the
systemic expansion of mitotic tissues. The preeminent regulatory mechanism for such synchronized growth between the
nervous system and the tissues it spans, is the biomechanical stretch of axons, a known stimulus of axon growth.  more...

Analysis of gene expression in Sox10 Dom mutant sacral neural crest cells
(Submitter supplied) Hirschsprung’ s disease (HSCR) is a congenital disease which is characterized by the reduction or
absence of neurons and glial cells in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Failure of neural crest cells (NCCs) to colonize the
gut during the embryonic development has been considered as one of the possible causes of the disease. In this study , the
migration and gene expression of sacral NCCs from the spontaneous mouse mutant Dominant megacolon (Dom) which is a
HSCR animal model expressing a mutated transcription factor Sox10, were analyzed in order to identify candidate genes
which may possibly af fect the NCC migration in the mutant.

Targeted suppression of metastasis controlling transcription factor SOX2 in various cancers using a sequence-
specific designer Pyrrole-Imidazole Polyamide
(Submitter supplied) SOX2 is a well-known transcription factor that plays a central role in maintaiing self renewal,
pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, and cell fate determination during embryonic development. N-Methylpyrrole-N-
methylimidazole polyamides (PIPs) are chemical compounds that can selectively recognize DNA  sequence and achieve
operative control over gene expression. In this study , the antitumor activity of a PIP  targeting SOX2 binding sequence
(SOX2i), which was recently shown to induce the targeted dif ferentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes, was evaluated.

Genome-wide expression changes induced by bisphenol A, F and S in human stem cell derived hepatocyte-like
cells
(Submitter supplied) The debate about possible adverse ef fects of bisphenol A (BPA) has been ongoing for decades and
bisphenol-F (BPF) and -S (BPS) have been suggested as “safer” alternatives. In the present study we used hepatocyte-like
cells (HLC) derived from the human embryonic stem cell lines Man12 and H9 to compare the three bisphenol derivatives.
Stem cell-derived progenitors were produced using an established system, and, during their transition to HLCs, they were
exposed to BP A, BPF and BPS for 8 days.  more...

Expression data from BAX/BAK double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast at baseline and following
exposure to genotoxic stress.
(Submitter supplied) The BCL-2 family proteins are central regulators of apoptosis. However , cells doubly deficient for BAX
and BAK or overexpressing BCL-2 still succumb to oxidative stress upon DNA  damage or loss of matrix attachment. Our
studies indicate a central role for the transcription factor deltaNp63alpha (referred to as p63 from this point forward) in this
form of non-apoptotic cell death. W e used microarrays to investigate gene expression in apoptosis-incompetent cells
expressing a control vector or p63, at baseline and following exposure to genotoxic stress, to further elucidate molecular
mechanisms regulating this type of non-apoptotic death and the role of p63 in this context.

ROS amplification drives mouse spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal
(Submitter supplied) Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in self-renewal division for various stem cell types.
However , it remains unclear how ROS signals are integrated with selfrenewal machinery . Here we report that the
MAPK14/MAPK7/BCL6B pathway creates a positive feedback loop to drive spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) self-renewal via
ROS amplification. The activation of MAPK14 induced MAPK7 phosphorylation in cultured SSCs, and targeted deletion of
Mapk14 or Mapk7 resulted in significant SSC deficiency after spermatogonial transplantation.  more...

(Submitter supplied) Purpose: Hirschsprung’ s disease (HSCR, OMIM 142623) represents one of the main causes of
neonatal intestinal obstruction. It is caused by dysfunction of neural crest cells (NCCs) and their progeny during
development of the enteric nervous system (ENS). HSCR is considered a multifactorial disorder , however , associated risk
genes only account for a minority of cases. Consequently , defining disease-relevant variants is still a demanding task.
